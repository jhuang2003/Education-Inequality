# Education-Inequality
The purpose of this project is to investigate and address the inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. We will focus on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams. 

# Data
We will utilize two datasets titled EdGap_data.xlsx and ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. The first dataset was gathered from EdGap.org https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987. It is composed of average ACT or SAT scores for different schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district from 2016. The second dataset is from National Center for Education Statistics https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp.
